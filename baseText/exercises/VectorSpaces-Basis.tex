\begin{ex}
  Consider $\Poly_{2}$, the vector space of polynomials of degree at
  most $2$. Determine whether the following is a basis for
  $\Poly_{2}$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \set{x^{2}+x+1,2x^{2}+2x+1,x+1}
  \end{equation*}
  \textbf{Hint:\ }There is a isomorphism from $\R^{3}$ to
  $\Poly_{2}$. It is defined as follows:\
  \begin{equation*}
    T\vect{e}_{1}=1,T\vect{e}_{2}=x,T\vect{e}_{3}=x^{2}
  \end{equation*}
  Then extend $T$ linearly. Thus
  \begin{equation*}
    T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      1 \\
      1
    \end{mymatrix} =x^{2}+x+1,T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      2 \\
      2
    \end{mymatrix} =2x^{2}+2x+1,T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      1 \\
      0
    \end{mymatrix} =1+x
  \end{equation*}
  It follows that if
  \begin{equation*}
    \set{\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        1 \\
        1
      \end{mymatrix} ,\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        2 \\
        2
      \end{mymatrix} ,\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        1 \\
        0
      \end{mymatrix} }
  \end{equation*}
  is a basis for $\R^{3}$, then the polynomials will be a basis for
  $\Poly_{2}$ because they will be independent. Recall that an
  isomorphism takes a linearly independent set to a linearly
  independent set. Also, since $T$ is an isomorphism, it preserves all
  linear relations.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Find a basis in $\Poly_{2}$ for the subspace
  \begin{equation*}
    \sspan\set{1+x+x^{2},1+2x,1+5x-3x^{2}}
  \end{equation*}
  If the above three vectors do not yield a basis, exhibit one of them
  as a linear combination of the others. \textbf{Hint:\ }This is the
  situation in which you have a spanning set and you want to cut it
  down to form a linearly independent set which is also a spanning
  set. Use the same isomorphism above. Since $T$ is an isomorphism, it
  preserves all linear relations so if such can be found in $\R^{3}$,
  the same linear relations will be present in $\Poly_{2}$.

\begin{ex}
  If you have $5$ vectors in $\R^{5}$ and the vectors are linearly
  independent, can it always be concluded they span $\R^{5}$?
  \begin{sol}
    Yes. If not, there would exist a vector not in the span. But then
    you could add in this vector and obtain a linearly independent set
    of vectors with more vectors than a basis.

  Let $\Poly_3$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most
  3. Determine which of the following are bases for this vector space.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\set{x+1,x^{3}+x^{2}+2x,x^{2}+x,x^{3}+x^{2}+x} $

  \item $\set{x^{3}+1,x^{2}+x,2x^{3}+x^{2},2x^{3}-x^{2}-3x+1} $
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{sol}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    \item
      Suppose
      \begin{equation*}
        c_{1}(x^{3}+1) +c_{2}(x^{2}+x) +c_{3}(
        2x^{3}+x^{2}) +c_{4}(2x^{3}-x^{2}-3x+1) =0
      \end{equation*}
      Then combine the terms according to power of $x$.
      \begin{equation*}
        (c_{1}+2c_{3}+2c_{4}) x^{3}+(c_{2}+c_{3}-c_{4})
        x^{2}+(c_{2}-3c_{4}) x+(c_{1}+c_{4}) =0

      \begin{array}{c}
        c_{1}+2c_{3}+2c_{4}=0 \\
        c_{2}+c_{3}-c_{4}=0 \\
        c_{2}-3c_{4}=0 \\
        c_{1}+c_{4}=0
      \end{array}

      \begin{equation*}
        \mat{c_{1}=0,c_{2}=0,c_{3}=0,c_{4}=0}
      \end{equation*}
      Therefore, these are linearly independent.

\begin{ex}
  Let the field of scalars be $\Q$, the set of rational
  numbers. Consider vectors of the form $a+b\sqrt{2}$ where $a,b$ are
  rational numbers. Show that this collection of vectors is a vector
  space over $\Q$ and give a basis for this vector space.
  \begin{sol}
    When you add two of these you get one and when you multiply one of
    these by a scalar, you get another one. A basis is
    $\set{1,\sqrt{2}}$. By definition, the span of these gives the
    collection of vectors. Are they independent? Say $a+b\sqrt{2}=0$
    where $a,b$ are rational numbers. If $a\neq 0$, then
    $b\sqrt{2}=-a$ which can't happen since $a$ is rational. If
    $b\neq 0$, then $-a=b\sqrt{2}$ which again can't happen because on
    the left is a rational number and on the right is an
    irrational. Hence both $a,b=0$ and so this is a basis.
