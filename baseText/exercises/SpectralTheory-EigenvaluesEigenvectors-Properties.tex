\begin{ex}
  Find the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue of
  the following matrices. Which of the matrices are diagonalizable?
  \begin{equation*}
    (a)\quad
    A = \begin{mymatrix}{rr} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 3 \end{mymatrix},
    \quad
    (b)\quad
    B = \begin{mymatrix}{rr} -7 & 8 \\ -4 & 5 \end{mymatrix},
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation*}
    (c)\quad
    C = \begin{mymatrix}{rrr}
      2 & -1 & -1 \\
      0 & 4 & 2 \\
      0 & -1 & 1 \\
    \end{mymatrix},
    \quad
    (d)\quad
    D = \begin{mymatrix}{rrr}
      3 & 1 & -1 \\
      0 & 2 & 1 \\
      0 & -1 & 4 \\
    \end{mymatrix},
    \quad
    (e)\quad
    E = \begin{mymatrix}{rrr}
      -2 & 0 & 1 \\
      -1 & -1 & 1 \\
      -2 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{sol}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\eigenvar=2$ has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric
      multiplicity 1. Since the sum of the geometric multiplicities of
      all eigenvalues is $1$, the matrix is not diagonalizable.
    \item $\eigenvar=1$ has algebraic and geometric
      multiplicity 1; $\eigenvar=-3$ has algebraic and geometric
      multiplicity 1. Since the sum of the geometric multiplicities is
      $2$, the matrix is diagonalizable.
    \item $\eigenvar=2$ has algebraic and geometric
      multiplicity 2, $\eigenvar=3$ has algebraic and geometric
      multiplicity 1. Since the sum of the geometric multiplicities is
      $3$, the matrix is diagonalizable.
    \item $\eigenvar=3$ has algebraic multiplicity 3 and geometric
      multiplicity 2. Since the sum of the geometric multiplicities of
      all eigenvalues is $2$, the matrix is not diagonalizable.
    \item $\eigenvar = -1$ has algebraic multiplicity 3 and geometric
      multiplicity 1. Since the sum of the geometric multiplicities of
      all eigenvalues is $1$, the matrix is not diagonalizable.
    \end{enumerate}
