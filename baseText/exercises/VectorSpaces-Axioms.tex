  of addition and scalar multiplication:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{rcl}
      (a,b) \oplus (c,d) &=& (a+c-1,\, b+d-1), \\

\begin{ex}
  Consider the set $\R$ of real numbers. Addition of real numbers is
  defined in the usual way, and scalar multiplication is just
  multiplication of one real number by another. In other words, $x+y$
  means to add the two numbers and $xy$ means to multiply them. Show
  that $\R$, with these operations, is a real vector space.
