\begin{ex}
  For $\vect{u},\vect{v}$ vectors in $\R^{3}$, define the product
  $\vect{u}\ast \vect{v} = u_{1}v_{1}+2u_{2}v_{2}+3u_{3}v_{3}$. Show
  that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{\vect{u}\ast \vect{v}} \leq (\vect{u}\ast \vect{u})
    ^{1/2}(\vect{v}\ast \vect{v}) ^{1/2}.
  \end{equation*}
  Hint: first show that the operation
  $\iprod{\vect{u},\vect{v}}=\vect{u}\ast\vect{v}$ is an inner product
  on $\R^{3}$, then use Proposition~\ref{prop:inner-product-and-norm}.
  \begin{sol}
    The operation $\iprod{\vect{u},\vect{v}}=\vect{u}\ast\vect{v}$ is
    an inner product on $\R^{3}$. Symmetry and linearity are
    straightforward to check, as is the positive definite
    property. Therefore, the claimed inequality holds by
    Proposition~\ref{prop:cauchy-schwarz-inequality}.
