\begin{ex}
  Consider the vector space of polynomials of degree at
  most $2$, denoted $\Poly_{2}$. Determine whether the following is
  a basis for $\Poly_{2}$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \set{x^{2}+x+1,2x^{2}+2x+1,x+1}
  \end{equation*}
  \textbf{Hint:\ }There is a isomorphism from $\R^{3}$ to
  $\Poly_{2}$. It is defined as follows:\
  \begin{equation*}
    T\vect{e}_{1}=1,T\vect{e}_{2}=x,T\vect{e}_{3}=x^{2}
  \end{equation*}
  Then extend $T$ linearly. Thus
  \begin{equation*}
    T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      1 \\
      1
    \end{mymatrix} =x^{2}+x+1,T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      2 \\
      2
    \end{mymatrix} =2x^{2}+2x+1,T\begin{mymatrix}{c}
      1 \\
      1 \\
      0
    \end{mymatrix} =1+x
  \end{equation*}
  It follows that if
  \begin{equation*}
    \set{\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        1 \\
        1
      \end{mymatrix} ,\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        2 \\
        2
      \end{mymatrix} ,\begin{mymatrix}{c}
        1 \\
        1 \\
        0
      \end{mymatrix} }
  \end{equation*}
  is a basis for $\R^{3}$, then the polynomials will be a basis for
  $\Poly_{2}$ because they will be independent. Recall that an isomorphism
  takes a linearly independent set to a linearly independent set. Also, since
  $T$ is an isomorphism, it preserves all linear relations.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Find a basis in $\Poly_{2}$ for the subspace
  \begin{equation*}
    \sspan\set{1+x+x^{2},1+2x,1+5x-3x^{2}}
  \end{equation*}
  If the above three vectors do not yield a basis, exhibit one of them as a
  linear combination of the others. \textbf{Hint:\ }This is the situation in
  which you have a spanning set and you want to cut it down to form a linearly
  independent set which is also a spanning set. Use the same isomorphism
  above. Since $T$ is an isomorphism, it preserves all linear relations so if
  such can be found in $\R^{3}$, the same linear relations will be
  present in $\Poly_{2}$.

  Let $\Poly_3$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most

  \item $\set{x+1,x^{3}+x^{2}+2x,x^{2}+x,x^{3}+x^{2}+x} $

  \item $\set{x^{3}+1,x^{2}+x,2x^{3}+x^{2},2x^{3}-x^{2}-3x+1} $

    \item
    \item
      Suppose
      \begin{equation*}
        c_{1}(x^{3}+1) +c_{2}(x^{2}+x) +c_{3}(
        2x^{3}+x^{2}) +c_{4}(2x^{3}-x^{2}-3x+1) =0

      Then combine the terms according to power of $x$.

        (c_{1}+2c_{3}+2c_{4}) x^{3}+(c_{2}+c_{3}-c_{4})
        x^{2}+(c_{2}-3c_{4}) x+(c_{1}+c_{4}) =0

  Let the field of scalars be $\Q$, the set of rational
  numbers. Consider vectors of the form $a+b\sqrt{2}$ where $a,b$ are
  rational numbers. Show that this collection of vectors is a vector
  space over $\Q$ and give a basis for this vector space.
  \begin{sol}
    When you add two of these you get one and when you multiply one of these by
    a scalar, you get another one. A basis is $\set{1,\sqrt{2}}$. By
    definition, the span of these gives the collection of vectors. Are they
    independent? Say $a+b\sqrt{2}=0$ where $a,b$ are rational numbers. If $a\neq
    0$, then $b\sqrt{2}=-a$ which can't happen since $a$ is rational. If $b\neq
    0$, then $-a=b\sqrt{2}$ which again can't happen because on the left is a
    rational number and on the right is an irrational. Hence both $a,b=0$ and so
    this is a basis.

  Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space. Based on the
  exchange theorem above, it was shown that any two bases have the same number
  of vectors in them. Give a different proof of this fact using the earlier
  material in the book. \textbf{Hint: }Suppose $\set{\vect{x}_1
    ,\ldots,\vect{x}_{n}} $ and $\set{\vect{y}_1,\ldots,\vect{y}
    _{m}} $ are two bases with $m<n$. Then define
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi :\R^{n}\to V,\psi :\R^{m}\to V
  \end{equation*}
  by
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi (\vect{a}) = \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}\vect{x}
    _{k},\;\psi (\vect{b}) = \sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j}\vect{y}_{j}
  \end{equation*}
  Consider the linear transformation, $\psi ^{-1}\circ \phi$. Argue it is a
  one to one and onto mapping from $\R^{n}$ to $\R^{m}$. Now
  consider a matrix of this linear transformation and its {\rref}.
  \begin{sol}
    This is obvious because
    when you add two of these you get one and when you multiply one of these by
    a scalar, you get another one. A basis is $\set{1,\sqrt{2}}$. By
    definition, the span of these gives the collection of vectors. Are they
    independent? Say $a+b\sqrt{2}=0$ where $a,b$ are rational numbers. If $a\neq
    0$, then $b\sqrt{2}=-a$ which can't happen since $a$ is rational. If $b\neq
    0$, then $-a=b\sqrt{2}$ which again can't happen because on the left is a
    rational number and on the right is an irrational. Hence both $a,b=0$ and so
    this is a basis.
