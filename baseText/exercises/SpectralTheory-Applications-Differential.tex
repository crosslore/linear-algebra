\begin{ex}
  Solve the following system of second order linear differential equations:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}r@{~}r@{~}r}
      y'' &=& -5y &-& 6z, \\
      z'' &=& 3y &+& 4z. \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}

  Solve the following system of second order linear differential equations:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}r@{~}r@{~}r}
      y'' &=& 4y &-& 3z, \\
      z'' &=& 2y &-& z. \\
    \end{array}

\begin{ex}
  Solve the following system of second order linear differential equations:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}l}
      x'' &=& -2y + 2z, \\
      y'' &=& x - z, \\
      z'' &=& x - 2y + z. \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}

\begin{ex}
  Solve the following system of first order linear differential equations.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}r@{~}r@{~}r}
      y' &=& 4y &+& 6z, \\
      z' &=& -3y &-& 5z. \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  Hint: The method is similar to that of second-order equations. Use
  the fact, known from calculus, that the equation $f'=kf$ has basic
  solution $f(x) = e^{kx}$. Here $k$ is any constant (positive,
  negative, or zero).

\begin{ex}
  Consider three coupled train cars as in
  Example~\ref{exa:coupled-train-cars}, except that all three cars
  have mass $1\kg$ and both spring have spring constant
  $k=1\frac{\SI{N}}{\m}$. Find and solve the equations of motion.
