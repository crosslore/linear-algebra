\begin{ex}
  Which of the following equations are linear?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)] $2x-3y+4z = -10$
  \item[(b)] $2.123x_1 + 5.541x_2 - 9.101x_3 = 11.012$
  \item[(c)] $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1$
  \item[(d)] $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}x+4^3y = \sin(\frac{\pi}{3})$
  \item[(e)] $x+yz = 3$
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{sol}
    All of them except (c) and (e).
  \end{sol}

\begin{ex}
  Consider the system of equations
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c@{~}c}
      x&+&2y&+&3z&+&4w &=& 4\\
      x&+&y&+&z&+&w &=& 2\\
      x&+&2y&+&2z&+&w &=& 2.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  For each of the following tuples $(x,y,z,w)$ of real numbers,
  determine whether it is a solution of the first equation, second
  equation, and/or third equation. Which ones are solutions to the
  system of equations?

  \begin{center}
    (a) $(2,0,-2,2)$ \quad
    (b) $(2,2,-2,0)$ \quad
    (c) $(1,1,-1,1)$ \quad
    (d) $(3,0,-1,1)$ \quad
    (e) $(2,-2,2,0)$
  \end{center}

  \begin{sol}
    (a) is a solution to equations 1 and 2, (b) is a solution to
    equations 2 and 3, (c) is a solution to equations 1, 2, and 3,
    (d) is a solution to 1 and 3, and (e) is a solution to equations
    1, 2, and 3. Only (c) and (e) are solutions to the system of
    equations.
  \end{sol}
