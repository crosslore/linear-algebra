\textit{\bookfulltitle} presents an introduction to the fascinating
subject of linear algebra for students who have a reasonable
understanding of basic algebra. Major topics of linear algebra are
presented in detail, with most proofs of important theorems
provided. Where possible, applications of key concepts are explored.

Each section begins with a list of desired outcomes which a student
should be able to achieve upon completing the chapter.  Throughout the
text, examples and diagrams are given to reinforce ideas and provide
guidance on how to approach various problems. Students are encouraged
to work through the suggested exercises provided at the end of each
section. Selected solutions to these exercises are given at the end of
the text.
