\subsection{Geometric description of the cross product}

The following is the geometric description of the cross
product. Recall that the dot product of two vectors results in a
scalar. In contrast, the cross product results in a vector, as the
cross product gives a direction as well as
a magnitude.\index{cross product!geometric description}

\begin{definition}{Geometric definition of cross product}{cross-product-geometric}
  Let\/ $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$ be two vectors in $\R^3$. Their
  \textbf{cross product}\index{cross product}, written
  $\vect{u}\times \vect{v}$, is the vector defined by the following three rules.
  \index{cross product!geometric description}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Its length is $\norm{\vect{u}\times \vect{v}} =\norm{\vect{u}} \norm{
\vect{v}} \sin \theta$,
where $\theta $ is the included angle between $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$.

\item It is orthogonal to both $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$.

\item The vectors $\vect{u}$, $\vect{v}$, and $\vect{u}\times
  \vect{v}$, in that order, form a right-handed system.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We note that the length of the cross product,
$\norm{\vect{u}\times\vect{v}}$, given by the formula
$\norm{\vect{u}}\norm{\vect{v}}\sin\theta$, is the area of the
parallelogram determined by $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$, as shown in the
following picture.%
