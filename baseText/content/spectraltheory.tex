\chapter{Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization}

In this chapter, we introduce the theory of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, and the technique of diagonalization. In the same way
that Gaussian elimination is a fundamental tool that permits us to
solve many different kinds of problems, diagonalization is also one of
the fundamentals tool of linear algebra. It has a great number of
applications in every field of mathematics, science, and engineering.
