\section{The cross product}

\begin{outcome}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute the cross product of vectors algebraically and
    geometrically.
  \item Compute the box product of three vectors in $\R^3$.
  \item Determine whether a system of three vectors in $\R^3$ is
    right-handed, algebraically and geometrically.
  \item Find the area of a parallelogram determined by two vectors in
    $\R^3$.
  \item Find the area of a triangle determined by three points in
    $\R^3$.
  \item Find the volume of a parallelepiped determined by three
    vectors in $\R^3$.
  \item Use properties of the cross product and the dot product to
    prove algebraic equalities.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{outcome}

Unlike the dot product, the cross product is only defined in $\R^3$,
i.e., only in $3$-dimensional space. The cross product of two vectors is
a vector.

We will first discuss the geometric meaning of the cross product, and
then give an algebraic description. Both descriptions are equally
important: the geometric description is essential for applications in
physics and geometry, whereas the algebraic description is necessary
for computing.
