\chapter{Inner product spaces}

One structure that we often use in $\R^n$, but which is missing from
abstract vector spaces, is the dot product. In
Chapter~\ref{cha:vectors-rn}, we saw how to use dot products to
compute the length of a vector, the angle between two vectors, and to
decide when two vectors are orthogonal. We also used dot products to
define the projection of one vector onto another, and to find shortest
distances between various objects (such as points and planes, two
lines, etc).

In this chapter, we will consider inner product spaces. An inner
product space is essentially an abstract vector spaces that has been
equipped with an operation that works ``like'' the dot product.
