\subsection{Geometric meaning of vector addition and scalar multiplication}


Now suppose we have a vector $\vect{u} = \begin{mymatrix}{lll}
u_1 &  u_2 & u_3 
\end{mymatrix}^T$ and we multiply $\vect{u}$ by a
scalar $k$. By Definition \ref{def:vectorscalarmultiplication},
$k\vect{u} = \begin{mymatrix}{rrr}
ku_{1} & ku_{2} & ku_{3}
\end{mymatrix}^T $. 
Then, by using Definition \ref{def:distancebetweenpoints}, the length of this vector is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\tup{\tup{k u_{1}} ^{2}+\tup{k u_{2}}
^{2}+\tup{k u_{3}} ^{2}} }=\abs{k }\sqrt{u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}+u_{3}^{2}}
\end{equation*}
Thus the following holds.
\begin{equation*}
\norm{k \vect{u}} =\abs{k }\norm{\vect{u}} 
\end{equation*}
In other words, multiplication by a scalar magnifies or shrinks the length
of the vector by a factor of $\abs{k}$. If $\abs{k}> 1$, the length of the resulting vector will 
be magnified. If $\abs{k}<1$, the length of the resulting vector will shrink. Remember that by the definition 
of the absolute value, $\abs{k}>0$. 

What about the direction? Draw a picture of $\vect{u}$ and $k\vect{u}$
where $k$ is negative. Notice that this causes the resulting vector
to point in the opposite direction while if $k >0$ it preserves the
direction the vector points. Therefore the direction can either
reverse, if $k < 0$, or remain preserved, if $k > 0$.

Consider the following example.

\begin{example}{Graphing scalar multiplication}{graphingscalarmult}
Consider the vectors $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$ drawn below. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(2,1);
\draw[->, thick, red] (4,1)--(5,0.5);
\node[below] at (1,1.25){$\vect{u}$};
\node[above right] at (4.5, 0.75){$\vect{v}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Draw  $-\vect{u}$, $2\vect{v}$, and $-\frac{1}{2}\vect{v}$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}

In order to find $-\vect{u}$, we preserve the length of $\vect{u}$ and simply reverse the direction.
For $2\vect{v}$, we double the length of $\vect{v}$, while preserving the direction. Finally 
$-\frac{1}{2}\vect{v}$ is found by taking half the length of $\vect{v}$ and reversing the direction. 
These vectors are shown in the following diagram. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(2,1);
\draw[->, thick, blue] (3,1)--(1,0);
\draw[->, thick, red] (5,1)--(6,0.5);
\draw[->, thick, red] (6.5,0.75)--(6,1);
\draw[->, thick, red] (4,1)--(6,0);
\node[above] at (1,1){$\vect{u}$};
\node[below] at (2,0.5){$\vect{u}$};
\node[below] at (5.5, 0.75){$\vect{v}$};
\node[above right] at (6.25, 0.75){$-\frac{1}{2}\vect{v}$};
\node[below] at (5, 0.4){$2\vect{v}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\end{solution}

Now that we have studied both vector addition and scalar multiplication, we can combine the two actions. Recall 
Definition \ref{def:linearcombination} of linear combinations of vectors. We can apply this definition to 
vectors in $\R^n$. A linear combination of vectors in $\R^n$ is a sum of vectors multiplied by scalars.

In the following example, we examine the geometric meaning of this concept. 

\begin{example}{Graphing a linear combination of vectors}{graphinglinearcombination}
Consider the following picture of the vectors $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(2,1);
\draw[->, thick, red] (4,1)--(5,0.5);
\node[below] at (1,1.25){$\vect{u}$};
\node[above right] at (4.5, 0.75){$\vect{v}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Sketch a picture of $\vect{u}+2\vect{v},\vect{u}-\frac{1}{2}\vect{v}.$
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The two vectors are shown below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(2,1);
\draw[->, thick, red] (2,1)--(4,0);
\draw[->, thick, purple](0,0)--(4,0);
\node[above left] at (1,0.5){$\vect{u}$};
\node[above] at (3,0.5){$2\vect{v}$};
\node[below] at (2,0){$\vect{u}+2\vect{v}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(2,1);
\draw[->, thick, red] (2,1)--(1.5, 1.25);
\draw[->, thick, purple](0,0)--(1.5,1.25);
\node[below right] at (1,0.5){$\vect{u}$};
\node[above right] at (1.75,1){$-\frac{1}{2}\vect{v}$};
\node[below left] at (0.75, 1){$\vect{u} - \frac{1}{2}\vect{v}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{solution}

Given any two non-parallel vectors $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$ in $\R^2$, we can create a grid of their linear combinations. The integer ones are pictured below. From this we can see that all vectors in $\R^2$ can be written as a linear combination of $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
\draw[->, thick, blue] (0,0)--(1.5,0.5);
\draw[->, thick, red] (0,0)--(0.5,1);
\draw[-, gray] (-2,-1.5)--(4,0.5);
\draw[-, gray] (-1.5,-0.5)--(0,0);
\draw[-, gray] (1.5,0.5)--(4.5,1.5);
\draw[-, gray] (-1,0.5)--(5,2.5);
\draw[-, gray] (-0.5,1.5)--(5.5,3.5);
