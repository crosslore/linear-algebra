  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Know that eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues
    are linearly independent.
  \item Compute the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of an
    eigenvalue.
  \item For a square matrix $A$, find a polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(A)=0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{outcome}

In this section, we state various useful properties of eigenvectors
and eigenvalues. The first question we consider is whether
eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are linearly independent. This
is indeed the case, as the following proposition shows:

\begin{proposition}{Eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are linearly independent}{linearly-independent-eigenvectors}
  Let $A$ be a square matrix, and suppose that $A$ has distinct
  eigenvalues $\eigenvar_1,\ldots,\eigenvar_k$ with
  corresponding eigenvectors $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_k$.
  Then $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_k$ are linearly independent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose, for the sake of obtaining a contradiction, that
  $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_k$ are linearly dependent. Let $m$ the
  the smallest index such that $\vect{v}_m$ is redundant, i.e., such
  that $\vect{v}_m$ is a linear combination of previous vectors.
  Say
  \begin{equation}\label{eqn:linearly-independent-eigenvectors-1}
    \vect{v}_m = a_1\vect{v}_1 + \ldots + a_{m-1}\vect{v}_{m-1}.
  \end{equation}
  Multiplying the equation by $A$, we get
  \begin{equation*}
    A\vect{v}_m = a_1A\vect{v}_1 + \ldots + a_{m-1}A\vect{v}_{m-1},
  \end{equation*}
  and therefore, since $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_{m}$ are
  eigenvectors,
  \begin{equation}\label{eqn:linearly-independent-eigenvectors-2}
    \eigenvar_m\vect{v}_m = a_1\eigenvar_1\vect{v}_1 + \ldots + a_{m-1}\eigenvar_{m-1}\vect{v}_{m-1}.
  \end{equation}
  Subtracting $\eigenvar_m$ times equation
  {\eqref{eqn:linearly-independent-eigenvectors-1}}  from
  {\eqref{eqn:linearly-independent-eigenvectors-2}}, we get
  \begin{equation*}
    \vect{0} = a_1(\eigenvar_1-\eigenvar_m)\vect{v}_1 + \ldots + a_{m-1}(\eigenvar_{m-1}-\eigenvar_{m-1})\vect{v}_{m-1}.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_{m-1}$ are, by assumption,
  linearly independent (because $\vect{v}_m$ was the leftmost redundant
  vector), it follows that $a_1(\eigenvar_1-\eigenvar_m)=0$, \ldots,
  $a_{m-1}(\eigenvar_{m-1}-\eigenvar_{m-1})=0$. Since the eigenvalues
  $\eigenvar_1,\ldots,\eigenvar_m$ are, by assumption, distinct, it
  follows that $a_1,\ldots,a_{m-1}=0$. But then
  {\eqref{eqn:linearly-independent-eigenvectors-1}} implies that
  $\vect{v}_m=\vect{0}$, contradicting the assumption that $\vect{v}_m$ is an
  eigenvector (and therefore non-zero).
\end{proof}

An immediate consequence of this proposition is that an $n\times n$-matrix
with $n$ distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.

\begin{corollary}{Distinct eigenvalues}{distinct-eigenvalues}
  Let $A$ be an $n\times n$-matrix and suppose it has $n$ distinct
  eigenvalues. Then $A$ is diagonalizable.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Each of the $n$ eigenvalues has an eigenvector, and by
  Proposition~\ref{prop:linearly-independent-eigenvectors}, they are
  linearly independent. Then $A$ is diagonalizable by
  Theorem~\ref{thm:eigenvectors-and-diagonalizable}.
\end{proof}

The next issue we consider is that of ``repeated'' eigenvalues. There
are two senses in which an eigenvalue can occur ``more than
once''. The first is if the eigenvalue appears as a repeated root of
the characteristic polynomial. For example, if the characteristic
polynomial is
$p(\eigenvar) = (1-\eigenvar)(1-\eigenvar)(3-\eigenvar)$, then we say
that the root $\eigenvar=1$ appears with multiplicity%
\index{multiplicity!of root of a polynomial} two, and the root
$\eigenvar=3$ appears with multiplicity one. We call this the
\textbf{algebraic multiplicity}%
\index{algebraic multiplicity!of an eigenvalue}%
\index{eigenvalue!algebraic multiplicity}%
\index{multiplicity!of eigenvalue!algebraic} of the eigenvalue.

The second sense in which an eigenvalue can occur ``more than once''
is when an eigenvalue has more than one linearly independent
eigenvector. In other words, when the eigenspace has dimension greater
than 1. We call this the \textbf{geometric multiplicity}%
\index{geometric multiplicity!of an eigenvalue}%
\index{eigenvalue!geometric multiplicity}%
\index{multiplicity!of eigenvalue!geometric} of the eigenvalue.

The following definition summarizes these concepts.

\begin{definition}{Algebraic and geometric multiplicity}{multiplicity}
  Let $\hat\eigenvar$ be an eigenvalue of a square matrix $A$. Then
  the \textbf{algebraic multiplicity} of $\hat\eigenvar$ is the
  largest power $k$ such that $(\hat\eigenvar-\eigenvar)^k$ is a
  factor of the characteristic polynomial. The \textbf{geometric
    multiplicity} of $\hat\eigenvar$ is the dimension of its
  eigenspace $E_{\hat\eigenvar}$.
\end{definition}

One would hope that the algebraic and geometric multiplicities are
always equal. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as the following
example shows.

\begin{example}{Algebraic and geometric multiplicity}{multiplicity}
  Let
  \begin{equation*}
    A = \begin{mymatrix}{rrrrr}
      3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  Find the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue
  of $A$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The characteristic polynomial is
  $(3-\eigenvar)^2(4-\eigenvar)^2(5-\eigenvar)$. Therefore, the
  eigenvalues are $3$, $4$, and $5$, with algebraic multiplicity $2$,
  $2$, and $1$, respectively. To compute the geometric multiplicity,
  we need to find each eigenspace. For $\eigenvar=3$, we must solve
  $(A-3I)\vect{v} = \vect{0}$, or equivalently,
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{rrrrr|r}
      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  This system has rank 4, and the only basic solution is
  $\mat{1,0,0,0,0}^T$. Thus, the eigenspace $E_3$ is 1-dimensional,
  and the geometric multiplicity of $\eigenvar=3$ is 1. A similar
  calculation show that $\eigenvar=4$ has geometric multiplicity $2$
  and $\eigenvar=5$ has geometric multiplicity $1$.
  The information is summarized in the following table:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Eigenvalue & $\eigenvar=3$ & $\eigenvar=4$ & $\eigenvar=5$ \\\hline
      Algebraic multiplicity & 2 & 2 & 1 \\\hline
      Geometric multiplicity & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{solution}

In the example, the geometric multiplicity is either smaller than or
equal to the algebraic multiplicity. The following proposition states
that this is always the case.

\begin{proposition}{Algebraic and geometric multiplicity}{dimension-eigenspace}
  Let $\hat\eigenvar$ be an eigenvalue of a matrix $A$, with algebraic
  multiplicity $k$ and geometric multiplicity $m$. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    1 \leq m \leq k.
  \end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  It is clear that $m\geq 1$, because each eigenvalue, by definition,
  must have at least one associated eigenvector. Therefore, the
  eigenspace is at least 1-dimensional. We must show $m\leq k$. Assume
  that $A$ is an $n\times n$-matrix. By assumption, the geometric
  multiplicity of $\hat\eigenvar$ is $m$, so the eigenspace
  $E_{\hat\eigenvar}$ has dimension $m$. So there exist $m$ linearly
  independent eigenvectors $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_m$ for the
  eigenvalue $\hat\eigenvar$. Extend $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_m$ to a
  basis $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_n$ of $\R^n$, and let $P$ be the
  invertible matrix that has $\vect{v}_1,\ldots,\vect{v}_n$ as its
  columns. Let $B=P^{-1}AP$. Since the first $m$ columns of $P$ are
  eigenvectors of $A$ for the eigenvalue $\hat\eigenvar$, it follows that
  $B$ is of the form
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{mymatrix}{ccccccc}
      \hat\eigenvar & 0 & \cdots & 0 & * & \cdots & * \\
      0 & \hat\eigenvar & \cdots & 0 & * & \cdots & * \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & \hat\eigenvar & * & \cdots & * \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & * & \cdots & * \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & * & \cdots & * \\
    \end{mymatrix},
  \end{equation*}
  i.e., the first $m$ columns of $B$ are like those of a diagonal
  matrix. Then from the cofactor method for computing determinants, we
  know that $\det(B-\eigenvar I)$ contains the factor
  $(\hat\eigenvar-\eigenvar)^m$. But since $A$ and $B$ are similar
  matrices, they have the same characteristic polynomial. Therefore,
  $\det(A-\eigenvar I)$ also has $(\hat\eigenvar-\eigenvar)^m$ as a
  factor. It follows, by definition of algebraic multiplicity, that
  $m\leq k$, as desired.
\end{proof}

We know from Theorem~\ref{thm:eigenvectors-and-diagonalizable} that an
$n\times n$-matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has $n$
linearly independent eigenvectors. We can re-state this in terms of
geometric multiplicity as follows.

\begin{theorem}{Geometric multiplicity and diagonalization}{multiplicity-and-diagonalization}
  An $n\times n$-matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if the sum
  of the geometric multiplicities of all the eigenvalues of $A$ is
  $n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By Proposition~\ref{prop:linearly-independent-eigenvectors},
  eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly
  independent. Therefore, by taking a basis of each eigenspace, we can
  obtain exactly as many linearly independent eigenvectors as the sum
  of the dimensions of all the eigenspaces, i.e., the sum of the
  geometric multiplicities of all eigenvalues. By
  Theorem~\ref{thm:eigenvectors-and-diagonalizable}, $A$ is
  diagonalizable if and only if this number is $n$.
\end{proof}

The final property of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that we will
consider in this section is the so-called \textbf{Cayley-Hamilton
  theorem}%
\index{Cayley-Hamilton theorem}%
\index{characteristic polynomial!Cayley-Hamilton theorem}%
\index{matrix!Cayley-Hamilton theorem}. It states that every square
matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial.

\begin{theorem}{Cayley-Hamilton theorem}{cayley-hamilton}
  Let $A$ be a square matrix and let $p(\eigenvar)=\det(A-\eigenvar
  I)$ be its characteristic polynomial. Then $p(A)=0$.
\end{theorem}

We will not prove this theorem here, but only consider an example.

\begin{example}{Cayley-Hamilton theorem}{cayley-hamilton}
  Let
  \begin{equation*}
    A = \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      3 & 4 \\
      -1 & 2 \\
    \end{mymatrix}.
  \end{equation*}
  Find the characteristic polynomial $p(\eigenvar)$, and compute
  $p(A)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The characteristic polynomial is
  \begin{equation*}
    p(\eigenvar)
    ~=~ \det(A-\eigenvar I)
    ~=~ \begin{absmatrix}{cc}
      3-\eigenvar & 4 \\
      -1 & 2-\eigenvar \\
    \end{absmatrix}
    ~=~ (3-\eigenvar)(2-\eigenvar) - (-1)4
    ~=~ \eigenvar^2 - 5\eigenvar + 10.
  \end{equation*}
  Applying the characteristic polynomial to $A$, we get
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    p(A) ~=~ A^2 - 5A + 10I
    &=& \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      3 & 4 \\
      -1 & 2 \\
    \end{mymatrix}^2
    - 5 \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      3 & 4 \\
      -1 & 2 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    + \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      10 & 0 \\
      0 & 10 \\
    \end{mymatrix} \\
    &=& \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      5 & 20 \\
      -5 & 0 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    - \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      15 & 20 \\
      -5 & 10 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    + \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      10 & 0 \\
      0 & 10 \\
    \end{mymatrix}
    ~=~ \begin{mymatrix}{rr}
      0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 \\
    \end{mymatrix},
  \end{eqnarray*}
  just as predicted by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.
\end{solution}
