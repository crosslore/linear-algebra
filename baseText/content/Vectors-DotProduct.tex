\section{The dot product}
\label{sec:dot-product}

\begin{outcome}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute the dot product of vectors geometrically and
    algebraically.
  \item Use properties of the dot product, including the
    Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the triangle inequality, to prove
    further equalities and inequalities.
  \item Determine whether two vectors are orthogonal.
  \item Compute the scalar and vector projection of one vector onto
    another.
  \item Decompose a vector into orthogonal components.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{outcome}

There are two ways of multiplying vectors that are useful in
applications. The first of these is called the \textbf{dot product},
and the second is called the \textbf{cross product}. We will consider
the dot product here, and the cross product in the next section.
